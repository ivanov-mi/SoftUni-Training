1. Write a program that reads two positive integer numbers and prints how many numbers p exist 
	between them such that the reminder of the division with p by 5 is 0 (inclusive). Example: p(17,25) = 2
2. Write a program that gets two numbers from the console and prints the greater of them. Don`t use if statements.
3. Write a program that reads the coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic equation ax2+bx+c=0 and 
	solves it (prints its real roots). 
4. Write a program that gets a number n and after that gets more n numbers and calculates and prints their sum. 
5. Write a program that reads an integer number n from the console and prints all the 
	numbers in the interval [1..n], each on a single line.
