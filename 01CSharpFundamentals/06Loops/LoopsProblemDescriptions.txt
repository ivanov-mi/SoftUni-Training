1. Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to N.
2. Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to N, that are not divisible by 3 and 7 at the same time.
3. Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of N integer numbers and returns 
	the minimal and maximal of them.
4. Write a program that calculates N!/K! for given N and K (1<K<N).
5. Write a program that calculates N!*K! / (K-N)! for given N and K (1<N<K).
6. Write a program that, for a given two integer numbers N and X, calculates the sumS = 1 + 1!/X + 2!/X2 + ... + N!/XN
7. Write a program that reads a number N and calculates the sum of the first N members of the sequence of Fibonacci:
	 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, ...
8. Write a program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of given two numbers. 
	Use the Euclidean algorithm (find it in Internet).
9. Write a program that prints all possible cards from a standard deck of 52 cards (without jokers). The cards should 
	be printed with their English names. Use nested for loops and switch-case.
10.  Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number N (N < 20) and 
	outputs a matrix like the following:
	n = 3 				n = 4
       1  2  3                        1  2  3  4 
       2  3  4                        2  3  4  5 
       3  4  5                        3  4  5  6  
 				      4  5  6  7
11.* Write a program that reads a positive integer number N (N < 20) from console and outputs
	 in the console the numbers 1 ... N numbers arranged as a spiral.

       n = 4
     1   2   3   4
     12  13  14  5
     11  16  15  6
     10  9   8   7
